# hypr
collection of dot config files for hyprland with a simple install script for a fresh install of Arch linux + yay

Based on:
    https://github.com/elifouts/Dotfiles
    and another one that I forgor his repo

Has alot of similarities with the mac shortcuts.
    $mainMod + q == quit
    $mainMod + shift + q == force quit

I don't like doing readmes.

## How to use:
    - ./hpyr/set-hypr
